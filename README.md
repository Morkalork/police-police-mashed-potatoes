# Police Police - Mashed Potatoes

This application will query the open Swedetish police events API, listening in on what happens in the fair
kingdom of Sweden!

```
git clone #REPO
```

Build the project:

```

This will generate a police-police-mashed-potatoes.exe file which you can execute in whatever way you find most suiting
(such as `./police-police-mashed-potatoes.exe`)

## Tests

There are tests available which can be executed by running the following command:

```
go test police-police-mashed-potatoes/
```

To get coverage, execute the following command:

```
go test -coverprofile=c.out police-police-mashed-potatoes
```

## Why?

I'm learning go, that's why. 

## No no dumb snut, why the name?

Oh, because of the swell old Swedish police film ["Polis, polis potatismos"](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107846/) with 
GÃ¶sta Ekman as DC Beck. Good times!
